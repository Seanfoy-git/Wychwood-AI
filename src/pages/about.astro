      Wychwood Partners is led by Sean Foy, an operator who has built and stabilised growth-stage and private equity-backed businesses across consumer technology, e-commerce, logistics, and asset-heavy multi-site platforms.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
      He is typically hired by private equity partners, boards, and founders when growth is outrunning control or performance needs to tighten.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
      His work sits at the point where growth meets constraint — margin drift, working capital pressure, post-acquisition integration, or founder-led execution that no longer scales. The focus is consistent: make the numbers reliable, define decision rights, and install a rhythm that holds under pressure.

        <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold">Operating track record</h2>

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
          At Amazon Devices, Sean was the first non‑US executive in the organisation, responsible for building the Rest‑of‑World supply chain from zero to 17 countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The platform scaled into multi‑billion‑dollar revenue under a disciplined international operating model.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
          At Shift Technologies, he helped scale an asset‑heavy, multi‑state automotive platform from approximately $85m to over $700m in revenue through to IPO, installing site‑level margin control, inventory discipline, and operating governance across eight facilities in four states.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
          At Enjoy Technology, he built and scaled a same‑day field operations platform to 51 US cities with a UK launch, designing a mobile inventory system and negotiating a multi‑million‑dollar consignment structure to protect working capital while expanding nationally.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-[rgb(var(--text-muted))]">
          Across venture, private equity, and public market environments, the common thread has been performance control — unit economics, cash visibility, integration discipline, and leadership cadence that converts strategy into repeatable execution.
        </p>
