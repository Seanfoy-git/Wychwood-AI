This engagement illustrates multi-state operating model architecture, regulated asset-heavy scaling, unit economics discipline, and IPO-ready operational infrastructure within a venture-backed consumer e-commerce platform.

## Situation

AutoDirect was a venture-backed online automotive retailer operating in a single metro area with approximately $85M in annual revenue. The company had product-market fit but lacked the operational infrastructure required for multi-state expansion.

Growth was constrained by facility buildout complexity, regulatory variation across states, inconsistent unit economics, and the absence of a standardized replication model. The leadership team needed an operating engine capable of scaling beyond the home market without degrading execution quality.

Inventory days were beginning to swell as reconditioning throughput lagged demand, and compliance complexity increased with state- and county-level regulatory variation. Without tighter operational controls, expansion risked amplifying margin volatility rather than creating leverage.

## What I Installed

**Multi-State Market Entry & Replication Playbook**  
Designed a repeatable multi-state market entry framework covering facility buildout, regulatory licensing, staffing model design, logistics integration, and site-level margin thresholds. Reduced new market launch time from 6+ months to under 90 days.

**Multi-Site Operating Model & Site-Level Margin Governance**  
Built and standardized a multi-site operating organization across eight facilities in four states, embedding site-level margin governance and cost accountability. Implemented performance management systems and operating KPIs across all locations.

**CFO-Integrated Forecasting & IPO-Readiness Discipline**  
Partnered with finance to align unit economics modeling, operational forecasting, capital planning, and investor reporting through multiple funding rounds and IPO preparation, ensuring board-ready financial visibility.

**End-to-End Logistics & Reconditioning Infrastructure Architecture**  
Directed vehicle transportation, reconditioning workflows, quality control, and last-mile delivery under a unified operational framework.

## Operating Mechanics

Execution discipline centered on:

- Relentless measurement discipline — throughput, cost per unit, cycle time, and customer satisfaction were visible weekly, owned explicitly, and reviewed until variance closed
- Weekly cross-site operating reviews
- Standardized SOPs with local accountability
- Clear ownership of margin drivers at site level
- Direct integration between operational metrics and board-level reporting

The objective was replication without degradation.

Market launches were gated by unit economics thresholds to ensure expansion did not outpace margin discipline.

## Outcomes

Revenue scaled from $85M to $700M (8.2x growth) while expanding from one regulated operating location to eight facilities across four states under a standardized multi-state operating model. A 1,000-person operating organization was built to support multi-state fulfillment. New market launches were consistently executed in under 90 days.

The operational infrastructure supported a successful IPO in October 2020, with operating performance and forecasting discipline sustaining growth momentum through the public listing process.

## Pattern

Scaling regulated, asset-heavy consumer businesses requires:

- Playbooks before headcount  
- CFO alignment before expansion  
- Standardization before geography  
- Discipline before growth  

The operating system must scale faster than revenue.
