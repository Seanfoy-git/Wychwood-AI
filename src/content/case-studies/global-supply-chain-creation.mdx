The brief was simple: build the entire Rest of World supply chain from nothing.

The company had a dominant U.S. devices operation, but no infrastructure to support distribution or fulfilment outside the United States. International revenue was an ambition. There was no operating capability behind it.

I joined as the first non‑U.S.-based executive and was responsible for building the full international supply chain across what became 17 countries.

There was no regional inventory model, no cross‑border logistics network, no customs playbook, and no executive visibility into international capital exposure.

International growth required regulatory navigation, multi‑country logistics co‑ordination, currency exposure management, and consistent service standards across diverse markets.

## What I Built

**International Supply Chain Model**  
Established the complete Rest of World supply chain covering procurement strategy, regional distribution hubs, inventory positioning, last‑mile partnerships, and cross‑border compliance controls.

**Multi‑Country Distribution Network**  
Built distribution capability across 17 countries, aligning carrier strategy, customs clearance processes, bonded warehousing where required, and standardised device handling protocols.

**Inventory & Demand Discipline**  
Developed international demand forecasting and inventory allocation models to balance service levels with working capital control and regional inventory velocity.

**Executive Visibility & Control**  
Integrated international performance metrics into enterprise reporting so leadership and the board had clear visibility on exposure, margin, and service reliability.

## Operating Mechanics

Execution centred on:

- Regional inventory thresholds aligned to demand velocity  
- Jurisdiction‑specific compliance controls  
- Unified service‑level targets across markets  
- Weekly international operating reviews  
- Structured risk planning for supply disruption  

Expansion was gated by operational readiness, not headline growth targets.

## Outcomes

The international operation scaled from zero to 17 countries, supporting multi‑billion‑dollar revenue growth across the devices portfolio while maintaining service consistency and capital discipline.

The business moved from a U.S.-centric operator to a globally distributed platform with controlled international exposure.

## Pattern

International expansion is rarely a geography problem. It is a control problem.

Global scale requires:

- Infrastructure before marketing  
- Inventory discipline before footprint  
- Control before velocity  
- Risk embedded in growth decisions  

Growth without control magnifies exposure. Properly built systems contain it.
