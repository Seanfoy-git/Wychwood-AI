## The pattern
Most growth-stage businesses don’t lack strategy. They lack an operating layer that turns strategy into weekly execution.

## The minimal operating layer
- A single owner per outcome
- A small set of leading indicators
- A weekly cadence that produces decisions
- Accountability loops that close the gap

## What changes first
Decision latency drops, priorities stabilize, and “busy” becomes “progress.”
