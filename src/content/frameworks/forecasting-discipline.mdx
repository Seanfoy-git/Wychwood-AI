## The forecasting gap
Most companies produce forecasts. Few can explain them.

Numbers move. Confidence shifts. Revisions become frequent. The board receives updates, not insight.

Forecasting discipline is about replacing reactive reporting with controlled visibility.

## What driver-based forecasting means
Driver-based forecasting ties outcomes to the variables that actually move them.

Instead of projecting revenue directly, you forecast:

- Pipeline volume
- Conversion rates
- Sales cycle length
- Pricing changes
- Capacity constraints

The model becomes explainable. Movement becomes predictable.

## The discipline layer
Forecasting discipline requires:

- Clear ownership of the forecast
- Defined confidence bands
- Scenario triggers (not vague best/worst cases)
- A weekly review cadence
- Explicit assumption tracking

## What changes first
When forecasting discipline is installed:

- Leadership confidence increases
- Decision speed improves
- Board conversations shift from variance to drivers
- Capital allocation becomes deliberate

Forecasting is not about precision. It is about controlled visibility and intelligent steering.
