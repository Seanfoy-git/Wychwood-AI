## The pattern we see
Most growth-stage businesses don’t fail because of strategy. They fail because strategy never converts into consistent weekly execution.

Leaders are aligned in principle, but execution fragments across functions. Priorities drift. Meetings expand. Forecasts become reactive.

What’s missing is a leadership cadence.

## What leadership cadence actually is
Leadership cadence is not more meetings. It’s a **repeatable weekly operating rhythm** that:

- Produces decisions (not just status updates)
- Surfaces constraints early
- Forces trade-offs
- Closes accountability loops

It is intentionally minimal. Complexity is the enemy of adoption.

## The core components
A durable cadence usually includes:

1. **Single-threaded ownership** for each outcome
2. **A small scorecard** of leading indicators
3. **A weekly leadership review** focused on decisions, blockers, and commitments
4. **Clear decision rights** (who decides, who contributes, who is informed)
5. **Follow-through loops** that track commitments to closure

## What changes first
When leadership cadence is installed properly:

- Work becomes directional instead of reactive
- Accountability clarifies immediately
- Cross-functional friction decreases
- Forecasts become explainable because decisions get made on time

Leadership cadence does not add bureaucracy. It removes ambiguity.
