title: Voice Guidelines

# Voice & Writing Standards

This site should read like an experienced operator speaking plainly — not a consultant selling frameworks, and not a machine assembling sentences.

The tone is institutional but human. Calm. Precise. Direct. British spelling throughout.

---

## Core Principles

1. Write like a practitioner, not an adviser

Avoid phrases such as “step in”, “unlock value”, “leverage synergies”, “transform organisations”, or similar consultant clichés. The work described here is execution, not theatre.

2. Prefer clarity over abstraction

Replace abstract nouns with concrete actions.

Instead of:
“Architected a multi-layer governance framework.”

Write:
“Defined decision rights, reporting lines, and escalation paths so execution stopped drifting.”

3. Use British spelling consistently

- organisation (not organization)
- optimisation (not optimization)
- programme (not program, unless referring to software)
- modelling (not modeling)
- behaviour (not behavior)
- prioritise (not prioritize)

4. Avoid inflated language

Do not describe routine competence as extraordinary.
Avoid words like “revolutionary”, “world-class”, “industry-leading”, or “best-in-class”.

Let outcomes speak for themselves.

5. Vary sentence rhythm

Not every sentence should be perfectly balanced or symmetrical. Some should be short. Some slightly longer. That variation signals human authorship.

6. Introduce grounded operator lines

Every few paragraphs, include a sentence that reflects operating reality — constraint, consequence, or commercial pressure.

Examples:
- “Revenue hides strain. Cash exposes it.”
- “If nobody owns the number, it is just reporting.”
- “Growth without margin control simply multiplies problems.”

These are not slogans. They are earned observations. Use them sparingly but deliberately.

7. Break perfect symmetry

AI-generated writing tends to produce balanced, evenly structured sentences. Avoid over-polished symmetry. Vary sentence length and rhythm. Allow short sentences to sit alone when they carry weight.

Example:
Instead of:
“Execution becomes financially coherent.”

Write:
“Execution only works if the cash reconciles.”

---

## Structural Guidance

### Case Studies

Each case study should clearly state:

- The commercial problem
- The structural constraint
- The decisive action taken
- The measurable outcome
- The principle learned

End with a short, grounded line — not a slogan.

### Frameworks

Framework pages should:

- Explain why the structure exists
- Show how it connects to cash and investment decisions
- Avoid overusing the word “architecture”
- Tie theory back to operating reality

Additionally:

- Each framework page should have a dominant vocabulary cluster (e.g., decision rights, variance, liquidity, ownership) rather than repeating the same institutional terms across the site.
- Avoid repeated use of “architecture”, “structural”, and “governance” within the same section.
- Every third paragraph should reconnect theory to operating reality.

### Services

Services pages must:

- Describe what is actually done
- Indicate when it is needed
- State the practical outcomes
- Avoid sounding like a generic advisory offering

---

## Words to Use Sparingly

architecture
institutional
structural
governance
integrated
capital-disciplined
optimisation
framework

These words are not banned — but if they appear repeatedly in the same paragraph, rewrite it.

If one of these words appears more than once in a short section, rewrite the paragraph using more concrete language.

---

## Final Test

Before publishing any page, ask:

- Would a founder recognise this as real operating work?
- Would a private equity partner see commercial clarity rather than marketing?
- Does this sound like a person who has done it — not studied it?

If the answer is no, rewrite.
