2. Tone Principles

The voice is:
	•	Calm
	•	Understated
	•	Institutional
	•	Operator-led
	•	Capital-aware
	•	Direct

The voice is not:
	•	Academic
	•	Buzzword-heavy
	•	Over-structured
	•	Over-explanatory
	•	Marketing-driven

If it sounds like a whitepaper, rewrite it.
If it sounds like a pitch deck, tighten it.

3. Vocabulary Guardrails

Primary Language (Use Freely)
	•	control
	•	ownership
	•	margin
	•	liquidity
	•	execution
	•	cadence
	•	discipline
	•	integration
	•	cost base
	•	capital allocation

Controlled Language (Limit Usage)

Use sparingly:
	•	architecture
	•	structural
	•	institutional
	•	governance
	•	integrated
	•	capital-disciplined

No more than 2–3 uses per page unless conceptually required.

⸻

4. Forbidden Phrasing Patterns

Avoid:
	•	“This engagement illustrates…”
	•	“The structural backbone of…”
	•	“Convert ambition into…”
	•	“Integrated capital-aligned execution…”
	•	“This framework becomes critical when…” (repeated pattern)

Vary sentence openings. Avoid rhetorical symmetry.

⸻

5. Sentence Style Rules
	•	Vary sentence length.
	•	Insert occasional short, blunt sentences.
	•	Prefer verbs over stacked abstract nouns.
	•	Avoid concept stacking (e.g., “institutional operating architecture for capital-aligned execution”).

Example shift:

Instead of:

Institutional operating architecture for capital-aligned execution.

Use:

Clear ownership, tighter numbers, and decisions that close.

⸻

6. Case Study Rules

Case studies must feel lived-in and operational.

Each case study must:
	•	Use concrete actions (built, negotiated, reduced, installed, reset).
	•	Include measurable impact where possible.
	•	Avoid academic framing.
	•	Avoid “This engagement illustrates…”
	•	Avoid excessive abstract language.

Case studies should read like operator experience, not consulting literature.

⸻

7. Framework Rules

Frameworks may be structured, but:
	•	Avoid identical section naming across all frameworks.
	•	Reduce repetition of “structural layer.”
	•	Replace some “governance” with “control” or “oversight.”
	•	Include at least one grounded operator sentence per page.

Example:

Growth hides problems. Margin exposes them.

Use sparingly.

Before publishing any new page:
